# Augie Project Guidelines

## Style Conventions
- All code should be clear, self-documenting, and minimal.
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces depending on language).
- Avoid inline comments unless critical; prefer block summaries above code.

## Logging Requirements
- All meaningful actions should be logged.
- Each session must be recorded in the form `session_NNN.md`.
- Logs should be human-readable, with timestamps where possible.

## Git Commit Rules
- Always commit after each logical step.
- Commit messages must be concise, accurate, and use the imperative mood.
- Do not amend commits unless instructed.
