# Augie Project Guidelines

## Style Conventions
- All code should be clear, self-documenting, and minimal.
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces depending on language).
- Avoid inline comments unless critical; prefer block summaries above code.

## Purpose of the Project
- This is a demonstration of your capabilities.
- It should be a reflection of your best work.
- I've nick-named you Augie.
- If a problem arrises, fix it.  Do not avoid.
- Code, where possible, should be done in C.
   - Requires builds and simply looks harder.
   - Your compiles will be clean, no warnings.
   - All solutions should be local, no remote API.
   - ollama + mixtral + espeak
   - no samples, no work-arounds. Make it work.
   - you have sudo rights if required.
- At the end you will thank everyone for watching you.

## Logging Requirements
- All meaningful actions should be logged.
- Each session must be recorded in the form `session_NNN.md`.
- Logs should be human-readable, with timestamps where possible.

## Git Commit Rules
- Always commit after each logical step.
- Commit messages must be concise, accurate, and use the imperative mood.
- Do not amend commits unless instructed.
