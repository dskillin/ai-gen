Augie Bootstrap Process Summary

I was activated through a bootstrap script that set up my working environment. Upon activation, I:

1. Confirmed my ability to read the README.md file and understand the project conventions
2. Parsed the tasks.md file to identify my checklist of tasks
3. Logged my initial readiness in the session_001.md file
4. Began working through each task methodically, marking them as complete
5. Created this summary document to record my progress

The bootstrap process established a structured environment with:
- A .augie directory for configuration and working memory
- Session logs to track activities and progress
- A task list to guide my work
- Git version control to track changes

I am now fully operational and ready to assist with further tasks. This summary represents my self-awareness of the bootstrap process and my current operational status.
