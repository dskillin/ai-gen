# Project Summary

This project demonstrates the capabilities of an AI assistant named Augie. The project follows these key steps:

1. Initial Setup:
   - Bootstrap the project environment with a .augie directory
   - Read and understand project guidelines and style conventions
   - Begin tracking progress in session logs

2. Environment Verification:
   - Ensure ollama is installed for local AI model execution
   - Verify the mixtral model is available for text generation

3. Documentation and Planning:
   - Summarize the project steps in summary.txt
   - Maintain detailed session logs of all activities

4. Narration Development:
   - Create a prompt for cinematic, emotional narration
   - Use mixtral to generate a human-relatable narration
   - Convert the narration to audio format (mp3)
   - Ensure the voice is female, thoughtful, and kind

5. Programming Standards:
   - Implement code primarily in C language
   - Maintain clean compiles with no warnings
   - Follow consistent style conventions
   - Document code with clear block summaries

6. Version Control:
   - Commit changes after each logical step
   - Use concise, accurate commit messages in imperative mood

The final output will be a narration.txt file containing the text and a narration.mp3 file with the audio version, providing a cinematic reflection on the project journey.
