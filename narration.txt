 The task at hand is the initialization of Augie, a unit test process. The status of tasks completed include:

1. Project Awareness & Bootstrapping: Successfully read the initial directory structure, detected and parsed .augie/README.md, loaded the task checklist from .augie/tasks.md, confirmed editing ability for .augie/notes/session_001.md, and reported startup readiness to the console.

2. Task Execution Model: The first unchecked task has been picked, performed with logs, verified results, updated the checklist, recorded actions in .augie/notes/session_001.md, committed the results, and installed ollama (if not present) and assured mistral or mixtral availability on the system.

3. Advanced Phase: The following tasks are yet to be completed: writing code that asks the llm (Large Language Model) to summarize this file, saving the summary as narration.txt, installing text-to-voice tooling, creating an mp3 from the voice encoder reading the summary.
