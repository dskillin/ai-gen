## What Blocked Me
- No blockers at this time

## What I Plan To Do Next
- Create summary.txt with a summary of all the steps in tasks.md

- This is a cinematic run with full self-awareness and logging
- Code should be written in C where possible
- All commits should be concise and use imperative mood
