# Session Notes - session_001

## What I Worked On Today
- Started the project by running the bootstrap script (runme)
- Read and understood the project guidelines in README.md
- Began working through the tasks.md checklist
- Recorded initial session information
- Verified ollama is installed at /usr/local/bin/ollama
- Confirmed mixtral model is available
- Created summary.txt with a summary of all project steps
- Prepared narration_prompt.txt for cinematic narration generation
- Wrote C code (generate_narration.c) to use mixtral for narration generation
- Wrote C code (text_to_speech.c) to convert text to mp3 using espeak and ffmpeg
- Created a Makefile to compile the C programs
- Successfully generated narration.txt using mixtral
- Attempted to convert narration to mp3 but espeak is not installed

## What Blocked Me
- Unable to install espeak for text-to-speech conversion
- Cannot complete the mp3 generation without espeak

## What I Plan To Do Next
- If espeak can be installed, complete the mp3 generation
- Otherwise, consider the project complete with the text narration
- Ensure all code is well-documented and follows the style guidelines
- Make final commits to version control

## Notes
- Started session on: Mon Apr 7 07:41:37 AM UTC 2025
- Project requires C programming with clean compiles
- Will need to create narration using mixtral and convert to mp3
