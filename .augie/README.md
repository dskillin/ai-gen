# .augie â€“ Project Convention

This folder contains configuration and working memory for Augie.

## Style Conventions
- All logs go into `.augie/session_XXX.md`
- Output is explained and commented where helpful.
- Code blocks are separated from narration by triple backticks.

## Logging & Notes
- Each task performed should be noted with:
  - Start time
  - Action taken
  - Result
  - Any files changed
- All entries should be written to the session log.

## Git Commit Habits
- Commit only after verifying a task is complete.
- Commit messages follow: `task: short summary of action`
